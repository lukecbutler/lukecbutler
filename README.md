# Hi there, I'm Luke Butler 👋

I am a **Computer Science Graduate Student** at the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW), specializing in building AI-driven web applications and automating complex workflows.

I bridge the gap between abstract requirements and deployed software. Whether it's architecting a RAG-based search engine for sociological research or automating inventory for small businesses, I love using Python and modern AI tools to solve real-world problems.

## 🌲 Beyond Code
When I'm not in VS Code, you can find me **long-distance backpacking**. I've completed multiple section hikes on the Appalachian Trail, where I learned that debugging a Tent setup in the rain is surprisingly similar to debugging deployment errors on a server.
